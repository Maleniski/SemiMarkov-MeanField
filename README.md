## Dashboard Description
The dashboard allows users to simulate the evolution of object proportions distributed in a finite number of classes. By default, the simulation runs with preset values, but these can be customized to fit specific needs.

### Key Features:
* Customizable number of iterations (or stages) for the simulation.
* Option to specify the number of objects in each class at stage zero and the transition matrix, uploaded as a single CSV file.
* Theoretical background information provided for a comprehensive understanding of the simulation process.
* Visual representation of the system's configuration evolution and a comparative analysis of the original model with the mean field model.
